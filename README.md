### * Operational Research

### * Machine Learning

### * Heuristic algorithm

### * Data analysis
1. cern-root: ROOT a Data analysis Framework, c++ is its main language. It is used widely in high-energy collision physics. THist, TGraph, its own file format(".root"), TTree, TChain and so on are useful for quick big data saving, reading, graphing and visualization. [cern-root home page](https://root.cern.ch/), [c++ class index](https://root.cern.ch/root/html604/ClassIndex.html)
